>Where the market ends and the mists fall away, the **Canopy Crest** begins — a winding collection of elegant nests and living dwellings stretched across the upper boughs. Silk awnings ripple in the wind, rope bridges creak underfoot, and the glow of lantern beetles paints soft blue-gold halos in the twilight. Neither opulent like the Spire nor ramshackle like the Burrows, the Crest is a middle place — grounded in community, elevated in spirit.
