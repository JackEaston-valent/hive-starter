>Built into a massive tree just off the main market hub, the Bark and Buzzard welcomes travelers through a wide, gnarled **knot-door** that glows softly in the dusk. A hanging sign shows a cartoon buzzard gleefully devouring a grinning bloodhound. Inside, the circular tavern radiates warmth from a central hearth, filling the air with the scent of stew, spice, and sapwood. Locals relax at low tables, chatting in the soft light while Ember Ale flows freely.
