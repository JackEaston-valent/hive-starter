>Nested within the spiraled bones of a colossal snail shell, **Aldor the Immense’s Emporium** sits like a pearl of power — ancient, decadent, and humming with arcane promise. Its polished, spiral interior gleams with gold inlays, velvet cushions, and flickering glyphs. Few who enter come away unchanged — or with full coin purses.
# Attractions
- Weekly-rotating stock of **authentic, exotic magical goods**
- **Spell components, relics, and artifacts** rare even by Drakkenheim standards
- **No haggling** — Aldor always wins
- Guarded by assassins, glyphs, and two steel-skinned **gorgon beetles** exhaling green mist
# Atmosphere
Luxurious, arcane, and theatrical
- sounds: soft chimes, snorting beetles, whispered incantations
- smells: fine tobacco, jasmine perfume, alchemical reagents
- Quirk: Interior curves subtly, throwing off depth perception and hiding arcane seals
# Layout
