>Carved into the twisted roots of a colossal fallen tree, the Chapel of Saint Ardenna rises like a cathedral of nature. Its stained glass windows glow with soft radiance, and a golden **Sacred Flame** flickers at its heart—visible from the forest floor like a beacon. Wind chimes of copper and glass sway gently outside, the only bells this chapel requires. Here, even the boldest adventurers whisper their prayers.
